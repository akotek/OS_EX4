1. DUPLICATES:
If client name appears more than one time in the received list,
consider it as one instance. For example:
calling “create_group osStaff Eshed,Eshed,Eytan” is the same as
“create_group osStaff Eshed,Eytan”.

this is may take on this:

// inputs to insert to the parse function
command_type commandT;
std::string name;
std::string message;
std::vector<std::string> clients;

// splits user input to workable pieces
parse_command(command, commandT, name, message, clients);

// TODO: should be handled in server side
std::vector<std::string> noDuplicatesClients;
// checks the client names are valid
for(string& client : clients)
{
    if (!(std::find(noDuplicatesClients.begin(), noDuplicatesClients.end(),
                  client) != noDuplicatesClients.end()))
    {
        noDuplicatesClients.pop_back(client);
    }
}
clients.swap(noDuplicatesClients);
// TODO: ^ should be handled in server side ^

2. CHECK IF IN GROUP:
Only a group member can send message to the group.
    - Because what if the current user didn't start the group?
